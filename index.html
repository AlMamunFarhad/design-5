          <h3>Experience Hassle-Free Water Damage Claims with Thompson Restoration</h3>
           <p class="pb-3">If you discover a water loss in your home or business, the first thing to do is to call a water restoration company. It is important to do this before contacting your insurance company because if a claim does not need to be filed there is no need to alert them of something that does not need their attention.</p>
           <p class="pb-3">While waiting for the water restoration company to arrive after turning off the source of the loss, if possible, the next step would be to take photos of everything before anything is moved.</p>
           <p class="pb-3">This is only recommended if the affected area of the water loss is safe to be in and clear of any electrical or environmental hazards. Once on site, our water restoration team will guide you through the next steps in restoring your home as quickly as possible.</p>
